# ChessGame
To further develop my programming skills, i'm attempting to complete a chess game aside of my current studies
For know i've kind of have set up a project design and currently implementing the piece movement logic.
I've also set up a "starting postion" using a builder pattern although i'm not convinct that it is a completly accurate 
implementation of the pattern but for now it works, i will look further on that down the line.

The goal is to set up a functional chess game with a in a winform application and maybe when that is done implement som sort of engine that you can play against.
Note that know is it a Console Application since it's easy to quickly test the methods in the console. In the future i will try to implement some proper tests also.
